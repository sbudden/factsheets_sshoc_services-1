**Virtual Collection Registry**

_Virtual Collection Challenges_

Any form of research relies on reproducibility and citability. Usually a scientific publication  will come with a bibliography based on persistent references. The same should apply for the documentation of the research data. This has become a topic of growing importance for researchers, as more and more research data becomes accessible online, gets re-used and cited. Furthermore, in the preparation of research data sets, the need for advanced ways to versionize, group and share data with collaborators within and outside one’s organisation has become paramount.

A Virtual Collection (VC) is a convenient means for referencing research data and other sources. It allows researchers to create an aggregation of various data resources connected to a certain research purpose. The virtual collection may cover resources from various repositories or other services, such as the result of database queries, as long as they are persistent. These resources will most probably have been generated by different researchers and teams and managed by different organizations. 

Since metadata is open and can be combined in an autonomous way, any researcher can build virtual collections. Ultimately, researchers, as well as other actors of the research cycle, may want to access the resources that are aggregated in such a virtual collection, which may require access permissions. 

The SSHOC Virtual Collection Registry offers a researcher-friendly way to organise research data references.

A researcher may:

- access large samples of data with regard to a specific research domain or research question which are investigated by an individual researcher or a research group;

- preserve the context of their research, which can be a collection of various resources and resource types, and thus facilitate its repricability for the sake of good scientific practice;

- creating special collections based on aggregations of selections of different data-catalogues for comparison;

- organize resources in a way that is suitable for the specific work process, i.e. combine metadata representations into self-defined views and hierarchies;

- share and work on special selections of resources with colleagues

While it is impossible to create new data-sets/corpora for every occasion and purpose, VCs will allow the researcher to arrange and re-use existing resources and collections for new purposes. VCs are independent of any particular resource repository implementation, hence the aim is to facilitate their creation and use from as many resource repositories as possible. 

_The SSHOC Virtual Collection Registry_

A way for registering, accessing and discovering Virtual Collections by simplifying access for researchers is provided by the Virtual Collection Registry (VCR), currently operated by CLARIN, the European Research Infrastructure for Language Resources and Technology. Creation of VCs by researchers from the whole Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) spectrum is possible, as the VCR metadata model is not limited to SSH only. 
The basis for the creation of virtual collections is a joint domain of compatible metadata descriptions. Thus, virtual collections can boost the re-usability of existing resources and facilitate empirically sound e-Science in the arts and humanities. While researchers would also like to see all interoperability (formats, semantics) problems solved, so that they can work seamlessly on the virtual collection, the VCR model does not require such format interoperability challenges already solved.
The SSHOC Virtual Collection Registry (VCR) aims to remember previous data selections allowing (a) populating a personal workspace of the researcher  and  (b) to share data selections with fellow researchers or broader/public audiences. An important feature that has been enabled by SSHOC, next to many usability improvements, is the creation of DOIs for virtual collections.
